<!-- bio below -->
Tiberiu Tesileanu is an Associate Research Scientist in the Neural Circuits and Algorithms group within the Center for Computational Neuroscience. His research is on learning and normative models in neuroscience, with recent work focusing on time series segmentation and motion detection. Tiberiu joined the Flatiron Institute in 2018.

Prior to the Flatiron, Tiberiu worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the CUNY Graduate Center, thinking about problems ranging from the dynamics of CRISPR in bacterial populations, to birdsong learning, to efficient coding in olfaction and vision. Before CUNY, Tiberiu was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, studying statistical properties of protein alignments, and before that he got a Ph.D. in high-energy particle physics from Princeton University.
