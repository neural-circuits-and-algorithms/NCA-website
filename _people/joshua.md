# Put your bio below, this is what appears to the right of your name and photo.
Josh is a Flatiron Research Fellow working with Mitya on a dynamical systems framework of neurons, with a particular focus on the reconstruction of a dynamics from sparse measurements, identification of independently evolving subsystems, and symmetry reduction. Josh recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a PhD in physics and MS in mathematics. Their dissertation explored extending the dynamical systems theory of Axiom-A chaos to fluid turbulence. Outside of work, Josh likes to go indoor bouldering, cycle, hang with friends, and do physics-for-fun.
