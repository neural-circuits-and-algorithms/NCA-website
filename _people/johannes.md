Johannes Friedrich joined the Flatiron Institute is an Associate Research Scientist at the Center for Computational Neuroscience. His research focuses on efficient machine-learning and optimization algorithms for statistical analysis of large-scale neural data, as well as on theories of neural computation, such as implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in biologically realistic neural networks. Friedrich comes to the Simons Foundation from Columbia University, where he was a postdoctoral research scientist in the statistics department and the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. Prior to working at Columbia, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. He holds a Ph.D. in natural science from the University of Bern in Switzerland and an M.S. in physics from the University of WÃ¼rzburg in Germany.
