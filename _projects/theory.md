Connectomes are brain wiring diagrams at the synapse level. They are crucial for reverse engineering circuit function but are extremely scarce. Connectome reconstruction is challenging because it requires imaging and identifying axons and dendrites over tens of microns at nanometer resolution.

Currently, the only imaging technology that can bridge this range of scales is serial electron microscopy. The bottleneck in connectome reconstruction lies in the tracing of axons and dendrites, through millions of serial electron micrographs.
