<p>Jason is a Postdoctoral researcher co-advised by Mitya at the Flatiron and Jayeeta Basu at NYU School of Medicine. On the theory side, his work encompasses interpreting neural activity in the framework of control theory. On the experimental side, he records calcium activity from the dendrites of hippocampal neurons in behaving mice to probe the dendritic mechanisms of flexible memory. Jason graduated from UCLA with a PhD in neuroscience working with Mayank Mehta, where his thesis focused on dendritic and hippocampal coding properties underlying navigation. Outside of work, Jason is an active trumpet player in the L Train Brass Band, Brooklynâ€™s home-grown community brass band.</p>
