<p>Tiberiu Tesileanu joined the group in 2018. His research focuses on learning and normative models in neuroscience, particularly in relation to time series segmentation, motion detection, and dynamical system learning. Prior to the Flatiron, Tiberiu worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the CUNY Graduate Center, thinking about problems ranging from the dynamics of CRISPR in bacterial populations, to birdsong learning, to efficient coding in olfaction and vision. Before CUNY, Tiberiu was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study, studying statistical properties of protein alignments, and before that he got a Ph.D. in high-energy particle physics from Princeton University.</p>
